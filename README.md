# Coursework Project

## Automated Identification of Fish Species (AutoFiS)

### Description
<ul>
<li>Development of this application was divided into two parts Machine Learning predictive model and Android app development.</li>
 <li>Machine Learning consist building of a model from custom dataset of anotated pictures of fish species in such a way that it takes an image as an input and predicts the specie as output.Tech stack used to build this model - Tensorflow and MobileNetV2.</li>

<li> Mobile Application Tech Stack -  Android Studio( with JAVA ), Firebase (to store user information), Tflite framework (implements the ML model into android).</li>
<li>
 This app is designed in such a way that the processing of image , generating prediction and retrieving or storing of user data is handled asynchrounously which makes the application faster and provide clean user interface.  </li>
</ul>
